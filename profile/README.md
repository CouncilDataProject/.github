# Council Data Project

A search engine for local government.

We aim to empower journalists, activists, and community members in
following council action by combining and simplifying sources of
information on municipal council meetings and actions.

More information on us and links to all of the municipalities we serve
are available on [councildataproject.org](https://councildataproject.org).
